description: " <p>'HoloKD Warriors' is a 3D open worldgame. The story is set against the backdrop of the fantastic and technological Cyberverse, a cybernetic world with diverse environments, inhabited and ruled by robotic humanoid beings that organize themselves in different spaces and cities.

<p>Despite wanting to live in harmony, many threats compromise order in the Cyberverse: the main threat is the feared villain Z and bugs, monsters that have the most diverse powers.

<p>To defend themselves against these beings, the inhabitants of the cyber world created the HoloKDs Technique, a method that consisted of using a deck of holographic cards, whose powers were based on analog devices used in sports and childrens games of the past."
