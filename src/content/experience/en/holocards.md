**Served as the Multiplayer Architect for an Open World Mobile Social Hub (Startup Rio), engineering the core networking layer.**

The technical challenge was to build a continuous "Cyberverse" where social exploration and active gameplay coexisted in the same shared space, without loading screens or instanced separation.

**Key Achievements:**
* **Seamless In-World Minigames:** Engineered the networking logic for **Obstacle Course (Parkour)** and **Precision Jumping** challenges that take place directly within the city environment.
* **High-Precision Synchronization:** Developed algorithms to ensure that the fast-paced movement required for minigames was smoothly replicated via **Photon** to all observers in the hub, minimizing latency on mobile devices.
* **Scene Optimization:** Structured a dense 3D world capable of handling the logic of multiple avatars and physics-based mechanics simultaneously on limited mobile hardware.
