**Led the engineering transformation of an innovative educational app, evolving it into a scalable, multi-language ecosystem powered by cloud architecture.**

I championed the technical strategy that supported the app's expansion into new markets (Denmark, Ukraine), bridging pedagogical goals with solid software engineering.

**Key Achievements:**
* **Addressables Architecture:** Architected a scalable content management system handling **740+ categorized assets** across 4 languages (PT, EN, DK, UA). This enabled dynamic loading, instant localization switching, and zero-downtime content updates across Android/iOS builds.
* **Team Leadership:** Managed a **4-person Unity squad**, overseeing technical design documents, task estimation, and code quality using Agile methodologies (Scrum/Kanban).
* **DevOps & Tooling:** Developed custom Editor Tools and templates that streamlined the full production cycle of games—from conception to coding and testing—reducing time-to-market.
* **Cloud Integration:** Implemented secure communication with **AWS API** and performed extensive mobile optimization to ensure high performance on diverse hardware.
