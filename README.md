# João Oliveira - Portfolio

This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio website, designed to showcase my trajectory as a **Unity Tech Lead** and **Senior Architect**.

## About the Project

This project was engineered to be a showcase of technical precision and modern web aesthetics. It serves as a central hub for my game development projects, technical breakdowns, and professional experience.

## Tech Stack

The application is built on a high-performance, modern stack:

*   **Core:** [Astro](https://astro.build) - For performance and Island Architecture.
*   **Component Library:** [React](https://react.dev) - For dynamic UI components.
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For a custom, responsive design system.
*   **Language:** TypeScript - For type safety and robust code.

## Highlights

*   **Performance:** Static Site Generation (SSG) for instant page loads.
*   **Design:** Custom "Industrial Clay" theme with "Squircle" aesthetics.
*   **Content:** Project archive with technical deep-dives and localized content.
